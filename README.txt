WALKABOUT README 

The walkabout jquery plugin is a plug and play tutorial for your website or app. It let's you define tutorial content with html data attributes. 

The steps are ordered by the data-tut-step attribute and the content of each step is determined by the data-tut-content attribute. The plugin is initialized by calling walkabout() on $(document). 

This is my first plugin and it has come into existence for my Hacker School application.
